# bike-lock-problem
I found a bike lock with letters!  Generate a list of valid words that will open the bike lock.  

##

Had a little help getting started from Charlie Axlerod on [Medium](https://medium.com/jsunderthescope/generating-a-list-of-valid-words-in-javascript-efd3955c8912).

## The Setup

There are 10 letters x four tumblers.

```

1 2 3 4

S L E D

P E N S

H Y M N

M H L M

T N R P

W R T Y

D U A L

L O O K

F A S T

B I K E
```

This of course doesn't mean the lock owner chose a valid word.  Just seems like the most likely starting point and the more interesting coding challenge.  

## Conclusion

I thought I would get a short handful of candidate words out of this but even with a selection of only the most 500 popular words in the English language it returns more than 200 results!
